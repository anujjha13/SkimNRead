Current limitations in using chimeric antigen receptor T(CART) cells to treat 
patients with hematological cancers include limited expansion and persistence 
in vivo that contribute to cancer relapse. Patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL) have terminally differentiated T cells with an exhausted 
phenotype and experience low complete response rates after autologous CART 
therapy. Because PI3K inhibitor therapy is associated with the development of 
T-cell-mediated autoimmunity, we studied the effects of inhibiting the PI3Kδ and 
PI3Kγ isoforms during the manufacture of CART cells prepared from patients with 
CLL. Dual PI3Kδ/γ inhibition normalized CD4/CD8 ratios and maximized the number 
of CD8+ T-stem cell memory, naive, and central memory T-cells with 
dose-dependent decreases in expression of the TIM-3 exhaustion marker. CART 
cells manufactured with duvelisib (Duv-CART cells) showed significantly 
increased in vitro cytotoxicity against CD19+ CLL targets caused by increased 
frequencies of CD8+ CART cells. Duv-CART cells had increased expression of the 
mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2, with an associated increase in the relative 
content of mitochondria. Duv-CART cells exhibited increased SIRT1 and TCF1/7 
expression, which correlated with epigenetic reprograming of Duv-CART cells 
toward stem-like properties. After transfer to NOG mice engrafted with a human 
CLL cell line, Duv-CART cells expressing either a CD28 or 41BB costimulatory 
domain demonstrated significantly increased in vivo expansion of CD8+ CART 
cells, faster elimination of CLL, and longer persistence. Duv-CART cells 
significantly enhanced survival of CLL-bearing mice compared with conventionally 
manufactured CART cells. In summary, exposure of CART to a PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor 
during manufacturing enriched the CART product for CD8+ CART cells with 
stem-like qualities and enhanced efficacy in eliminating CLL in vivo.
